# Introduction
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon is a tactical first person shooter game released in 2001 by developer 
Red Storm Entertainment. In each mission you create your squad of 6 soldiers and using cunning 
strategies attempt to defeat the enemy forces and accomplish other objectives. This guide is intended 
to give you a brief introduction to the campaign mode of the game and some of its systems so that 
you may be able to understand it.

# Installation
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon is available on both Good Old Games and Steam.

# Getting Started

</p>
First thing you would want to do is open the options and change settings such as graphics and sound 
accordingly, then take a look at the input section and change keybinds as you see fit as I found the 
default keys to be unintuitive. Once you seem to have settings to your liking go back to the main 
menu and continue to the training section which will walk you through the basics of the game that 
will be mentioned again later. Adjust settings again during this time making sure that they make sense to you. 

# Playing your First Mission

### Mission Briefing

</p>
After completing the training section go back to the main menu and select campaign and create a new campaign, 
I would recommend starting with veteren difficulty to provide a challenge while still being very doable. You 
will then be greeted by the mission briefing screen, this screen shows up before every mission and gives you 
the context for what you are doing and providing the objectives you will need to complete. Pay attention in 
this section as special requirements for the mission may be mentioned such as needing anti-tank rockets or demolition charges.

### Platoon Setup
<p align="center">
	<img src="../images/grsquadsetup.png" alt="Image highlighting each section of the platoon set up page" width=750>
</p>
Once you are done reading or listening to the mission briefing click the arrow in the bottom right to continue
to the platoon setup page. Here you will assemble your team of up to 6 soldiers for the next mission. There
is a lot of information on this page that I will break down below. 

1. Team setup, after clicking on a soldier in the list you have the option to assign them to a team by pressing 
the A B or C buttons at the top of the platoon section. This will assign them to team Alpha, Bravo, or Charlie 
respectively. Each team can have up to 3 members and can be promoted within the team by pressing the button corresponding 
to its current team, or can be moved to another team in the same fashion. Pressing the X will remove the unit from the team.

2. List of all soldiers, separated by standard and specialist. You will gain specialists by completing optional
objectives in each mission (Marked with an X in the mission briefing). The menu has the soldier's name and 
their class, which will determine what kind of weapons and equipment they can use. 

3. This window displays the current unit selected along with their name which can be changed by clicking on the box in 
the top right and typing in a new name.

4. This box would show the medals that have been earned by this unit, medals signifying accomplishments by the unit but
do not have any effect on gameplay. 

5. Stats of the currently selected unit, after completing a mission all surviving units are given a combat point that can 
then be put into any one of these stats.
    - Weapon: Effects how fast the weapon crosshair converges when controlling this unit.
	- Stealth: Effects how close the unit can get to enemies before being detected.
	- Endurance: Effects the number of wounds the unit can take before being injured or killed.
	- Leadership: Every three points of leadership causes a single increase in all stat points for members of the units team.
	However this only occurs once per team based on the unit with the highest leadership.
	

6. Kit selection, using the arrows you navigate the selected units loadout, this includes selecting equipment that may be required for a mission such as anti-tank rockets or demolition charges.  

Once you have created a platoon pressing the error in the bottom right will start the mission.

### In Game Heads Up Display
<p align="center">
	<img src="../images/gringame1.png" alt="Image showing heads up dispaly in game" width=1000>
</p>
Loading into the mission you will be presented with your heads up display (HUD) with information about the current unit you 
are controlling. In the bottom left is the name of the unit, their ***stance*** (Standing, crouching, prone), their ***status*** (Healthy, 
wounded, dead), and the team they’re on. In the middle of the screen is your ***reticle*** which will remain in place no matter what, 
but the tick marks that move around based on your movement indicate the actual spread of your shots. In the bottom center is the 
***threat indicator***, the outermost ring will light up red in the direction from which you are hearing funfire, the smaller ring 
indicates the direction of further away enemies by lighting up yellow, and the inner circle will light up red whenever there 
are enemies nearby. In the bottom right is the weapons the current unit has, with the one equipped being lit up and the fire 
mode (depending on weapon can be semi, burst, or full auto) is displayed in the vertical bar to the right of the weapons. 

### In Game Menus
<p float="center">
	<img src="../images/grstats.png" alt="Menu displaying the status of each unit" width="475">
	<img src="../images/grcmdmap.png" alt="Map of the play area, with location of each unit and objective" width="475">
</p>
By opening up stat mode (left) using your assigned key binding you are presented with this menu, showing every unit and 
all their information as gone over before. By clicking on a unit you will take control of them, signified by them being
highlighted. While controlling a unit all members of that team will follow you and copy whatever position you take up.  

By opening up the command map (right) with your assigned key binding you will see a map of the whole mission area. The unit you 
are controlling is highlighted green and at the top of the map the squad you are currently giving directions to is 
highlighted, in order to give instructions to a team click on the letter corresponding to them on the left side of 
the map, and then select where you would like for them to move. 

### Command Menu Options
<p align="center">
	<img src="../images/grroemove1.png" alt="Command map depicting each type of movement command and rule of engagement" width=1000>
</p>
In  addition to selecting where you want units to move you can also select the manner in which they do so. Next to each squad's 
corresponding letter on the left are 2 additional icons, the top one represents movement and the bottom represents rules of 
engagement, with 3 options for each, for movement these are
1. Double green arrow: advance at all costs, will move even when under fire from enemies.
2. Single yellow arrow: normal advance, will move but will stop once coming under fire.
3. Red X: hold position, will stop currently planned movement and stay still until changed to another type of movement. 

And for rules of engagement these are

1. Suppress: squad will shoot if they think enemies are nearby, lots of fire but not accurate.
2. Assault: squad will shoot at any enemies they see.
3. Recon: squad will not shoot at enemies unless they are fired upon first.

<p align="center">

</p>
Enemies that have been spotted by a friendly unit will show up on the command map as a bright red diamond, but if not seen 
recently will fade away until seen again. This goes for any unit in your platoon, not just the one you control so it is 
helpful to alway look at the command map to locate enemy positions. 

### Pause Menu
<p align="center">
	<img src="../images/grpause1.png" alt="Pause menu with objectives" width=1000>
</p>
If you ever need to remember what objectives you need to complete you can press the escape key to pause the game and view them, 
from this menu you may also save the game, change options, or restart/exit the mission.

# Frequently Asked Questions
#### Q: Why does my screen get really small when launching the game?
- The game launches in a fixed resolution so will be to small for most modern day monitors, however this is fixed once you're actually in game
assuming you have selected the correct resolution in the options menu.

#### Q: Why do I keep getting killed?
- You're basically dead to 1 shot in game, so you should take it slow and make sure that you keep moving your teams so that they are in
advantageous positions. This is not a game you can speed through and it pays to make smart decisions on when to fight.

#### Q: How should I stop my team members from getting killed?
- By making use of the quick save and quick load keys (F5 and F7) you can save before making choices that may cost you your units. It should
be noted to be careful because quick saving at the wrong time may mean the only way to save a unit is restart the entire mission.

#### Q: I beat the last mission, is there any more?
- There are 2 DLCs for the game which can be purchased aswell as the multiplayer mode. There are also free mods for the game that greatly 
expand the game such as Heroes Unleashed.
