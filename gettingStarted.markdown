First you should open the options and change settings such as graphics and sound 
accordingly, then take a look at the input section and change keybinds as you see fit. 

Once you have the settings to your liking go back to the main 
menu and continue to the training section which will walk you through the basics of the game that 
will be mentioned again later. Adjust settings again during this time making sure that they make sense to you.
